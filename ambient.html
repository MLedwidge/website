          <p class="description">I am interested in the ways in which memory or historical information is embedded intentionally or not, within implicit everyday experiences of the built environment. The collective inferences, physiological affordances, and narratives which these untimely structures allow can function as devices for orientation. Resisting direct communication or visualization of historical information, the work instead aims to model a relation to historical revelation which addresses its subject through the happenstance encounter at the edge of intelligibility in time as well as visual perception. </p>

            <p class="description">
          Consisting of several spatially distributed artifacts which claim no additional space beyond the architectural envelope, It is my intention that their conditions of legibility may emerge from the use of the space they occupy in everyday life. Embedded flush within the gaps produced by the disaggregation of the industrially produced urban surface they form an array which together might inaugurate a stopgap mnemonic– encoding and searching for that which has past.In conversation with the histories at MIT of perceptually-oriented urban planning projects, environmental art, and contemporary technologies of computational urban science, informatics and its predictive agential mapping, I seek to think this work in relation to that which is registered yet unseen within technical description. I am interested in generating images which might not look or look only indirectly, for the potentials of meaning-making across scales and to model ambulatory peripheral visualities and practices of looking.
