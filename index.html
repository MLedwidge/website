      <p>
        Matthew Ledwidge is an artist working with site-specific installations, photography, sculpture, and video. His work engages with the historical conditions of the production of knowledge, imagination, and attention. He uses simulation technologies to explore the agency of technical models and their artistic and political effects. His recent projects have incorporated urban simulation models, climate sensors, photogrammetry, and architectural rendering to explore the epistemology of images and histories of attention in the built environment.
